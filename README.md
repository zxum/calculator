# calculator

Parameters from The Odin Project, Web Development 101, Project: Calculator

1. Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items and testing them in your browser’s console. 
2. Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key. 
3. Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons… you should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.
4. Make the calculator work without using eval()! 
5. Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer.
6. EXTRA CREDIT: Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals!
7. EXTRA CREDIT: Make it look nice! This can be a good portfolio project… but not if it’s UGLY. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.
8. EXTRA CREDIT: Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
